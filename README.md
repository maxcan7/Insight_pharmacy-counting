My Insight Data Engineering Fellowship pharmacy-counting code challenge repo

The script was written in python, and takes as inputs a filename for the input, and a filename for the output. The input file is assumed to be a .txt file with drug_name and drug_cost fields.

The script was written without the use of tools such as pandas or numpy.

The shell should be run in git bash from the git repo directiory, using 
"chmod +x pharmacy_counting.sh" to make the shell executable and running 
"pharmacy_counting.sh"

It assumes you are using itcont.txt located in the input folder as the input. The input can be changed to anything, it would just require changing the input in the shell script pharmacy_counting.sh to the path for the new input. As long as the input file has the necessary fields, it does not need to be itcont.txt. The output file can be renamed to anything.
